# SampleRCodes
Two example R codes from the contributor. More systematic analysis codes will be available once the research paper is published.


#Calcultae_Mean_FoldChange_PN.R
This code is used to calculate the abundance fold change of different BGC classes between two bacterial groups.

#Class_ENRCH_HMP_PN.R
This code is used to plot a complex heatmap based on the calculated fold changes.
